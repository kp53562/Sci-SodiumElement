  <h1>Sodium - The 11th Element in the Periodic Table of Elements.</h1>
  <p class="font-sciency">
    Sodium is a very soft, reactive metal. It appears silvery-gray and shiny when unoxidized but tarnishes rapidly in air.
    It conducts electricity and heat well, though because it is so reactive, it is not usually used in electronics, with some exceptions 
    (<a href="https://kp53562.github.io/Sci-SodiumElement/compounds/#sodium-ion-battery">see sodium-ion battery</a>).
    <br> Sodium is elastic, though still very soft and malleable. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Sodium is so soft, it can be cut with a knife.</p><br>

    As you can see, cutting the sodium exposes the inside where it has not yet oxidized. <br>
    It can be easily cut with a knife, but reacts very quickly with air, so the inside will soon oxidize.<br>

    Sodium normally floats on water during demonstrations of its infamous reaction with water.
    This is because it has a density of 0.97 grams per cubic centimeter, <br>
    which means it is less dense than water; water has a density of exactly 1 gram per cubic centimeter.
    Sodium is solid at room temperature because it melts at 97.79 Celsius, 
    while it boils at 882.8 Celsius, allowing for a large temperature range in between.<br>

    Sodium, like its relatives in the alkali metals group (Lithium, Potassium, etc.), has one valence electron, <br> 
    which makes the alkali metals group very chemically reactive and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=electropositive">electropositive</a>.
    The alkali metals group is the first column of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+periodic+table">the periodic table</a>,
