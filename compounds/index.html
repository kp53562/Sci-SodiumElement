  <h1>Sodium - The 11th Element in the Periodic Table of Elements.</h1>
  <p class="font-sciency">
    There are numerous useful compounds that sodium can form, including sodium hydroxide, or lye, and sodium chloride, or table salt.<br>
    Because of its reactivity, especially with air and water, it is rarely used in its pure form, but some nuclear reactors use liquid sodium as a coolant
    (It has impressive thermal conductivity,
    sodium's properties are further explained in the <a href="https://kp53562.github.io/Sci-SodiumElement/properties">properties page</a>);
    for the same reason, it is also used in science demonstrations.

  <h3>
    Lye (Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH)
  </h3><!-- headache remedy part & sodium image(img in main)-->
  <ul>
    <li>Sodium was first extracted and discovered through the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=electrolysis+definition">electrolysis</a> of this compound.</li>
    <li>Lye was used even as long ago as 2800 B.C. in making soaps because of its ability to 
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=saponification">saponificate</a> fats and oils.</li>
    <li>Lye can be created through the infamous reaction between sodium and water, also releasing combustible hydrogen gas in the single replacement reaction.<br>
    Because of this and how difficult it is to get pure metallic sodium due to its reactivity, lye is usually produced through electrolysis of salt and water instead.</li>
  </ul>
    <br>
  <h3>Salt (Sodium Chloride, NaCl)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The best known and most common compound sodium forms is table salt, or sodium chloride.</li>
      <li>Salt is used in many things. Most life forms need salt to survive,<br>
        and humans regularly consume so much of it that doctors even recommend some people to stay away from it.</li>
      <li>Fun fact: Sodium chloride is the most delicious form of salt. Lithium chloride tastes oily and metallic,<br> while 
      potassium chloride, rubidium chloride, and cesium chloride taste very metallic and potentially bitter.</li><br>

        contain so much salt that drinking its water makes you even more dehydrated!">
      <br><p> Oceans are filled with salt water. The salt comes from rock salt being dissolved in streams and washing down to the ocean.<br>
        This means that all sea salt is technically rock salt.

  <h3>Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate, NaHCOâ‚ƒ)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Baking soda has many uses. Its main use, which is where its name comes from, is in baking. <br>
      It releases carbon dioxide and leavens bread by reacting with various acids and liquids found in the mixture it's added into.</li>
      <li>Baking soda is also used as an antiacid, by reacting with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to produce salt, water, and carbon dioxide.<br>
        Sodium itself also plays an important role in the human body.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>The Human Body</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sodium is used in neurological function in the human body and maintains a proper balance of water and minerals.</li>
      <li>Without sodium, the human body cannot regulate water, causing blood to be more diluted. <br>
      Too much sodium can cause a stroke, and both are potentially serious medical conditions.
        See <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sodium+deficiency">sodium deficiency</a> and
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hypernatremia">hypernatremia</a>, respectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Extra!</strong> Water levels in cells are regulated by osmosis. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=osmosis">Osmosis</a>
        is a phenomenon where water moves through a substance that lets some liquid(water) through it to an area where there is less water than
        the other side.<br> In other words, water moves from where it is concentrated to an area of lower concentration, through a semi-permeable membrane.
        Salt can affect this process by changing the concentration of water in an area.<br> When salt has a higher concentration than water, water moves
        through membranes(such as human cell membranes) to that area in order to equalize the concentration of water. <br>
        When there is too much salt in the blood, water in cells move through the cell membrane through osmosis.<br> This causes the cell to dry out,
        and the reverse is possible when there is too little salt. In the reverse case, lots of water moves through the cell membrane into the cell,
        causing the cell to explode.
