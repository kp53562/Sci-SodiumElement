  <h1>Sodium - The 11th Element in the Periodic Table of Elements.</h1>
  <script src="list-controls.js"></script>
  <p class="font-sciency indent">
    There are numerous useful compounds that sodium can form, including sodium hydroxide, or lye, and sodium chloride, or table salt.<br>
    Because of its reactivity, especially with air and water, it is rarely used in its pure form, but some nuclear reactors use liquid sodium as a coolant
    <br>(It has impressive thermal conductivity,
    sodium's properties are further explained in the <a href="https://kp53562.github.io/Sci-SodiumElement/properties">properties page</a>);
    for the same reason, it is also used in science demonstrations.
    <br>
    The list below of compounds and uses of sodium are not comprehensive in any way, and there are many more uses for such a common element.

  <h3>
    Lye (Sodium Hydroxide, NaOH)
  </h3><button onclick="hideOrShowList(1)"><img id="1b" src="../assets/expand-list_button.png" width=32 height=32 alt="Expand" title="Expand/Contract"></button>
  <ul style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden;" id="1">
    <li>Sodium was first extracted and discovered through the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=electrolysis+definition">electrolysis</a> of this compound.</li>
    <li>Lye was used even as long ago as 2800 B.C. in making soaps because of its ability to 
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=saponification">saponificate</a> fats and oils.</li>
    <li>Lye can be created through the infamous reaction between sodium and water, also releasing combustible hydrogen gas in the single replacement reaction.<br>
    Because of this and how difficult it is to get pure metallic sodium due to its reactivity, lye is usually produced through electrolysis of salt and water instead.</li>
  </ul>
    <br>
  <h3>Salt (Sodium Chloride, NaCl)</h3><button onclick="hideOrShowList(2)">
    <img src="../assets/expand-list_button.png" width=32 height=32 id="2b" alt="Expand" title="Expand/Contract"></button>
  <ul style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden;" id="2">
      <li>The best known and most common compound sodium forms is table salt, or sodium chloride.</li>
      <li>Salt is used in countless things. Most life forms need salt to survive,<br>
        and humans regularly consume so much of it that doctors even recommend some people to stay away from it.</li>
      <li>Fun fact: Sodium chloride is the best-tasting form of chlorine salt. Lithium chloride tastes oily and metallic,<br> while 
      potassium chloride, rubidium chloride, and cesium chloride taste very metallic and potentially bitter.</li><br>

        contain so much salt that drinking its water makes you even more dehydrated! See 'The Human Body'.">
      <br><p> Oceans are filled with salt water. The salt comes from rock salt being dissolved in streams and washing down to the ocean.<br>
        This means that all sea salt is technically rock salt.

  <h3>Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate, NaHCOâ‚ƒ)</h3>
    <button onclick="hideOrShowList(3)"><img id="3b" src="../assets/expand-list_button.png" width=32 height=32 alt="Expand" title="Expand/Contract"></button>
    <ul style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden;" id="3">
      <li>Baking soda has many uses. Its main use, which is where its name comes from, is in baking. <br>
      It releases carbon dioxide and leavens bread by reacting with various acids and liquids found in the mixture it's added into.</li>
      <li>Baking soda is also used as an antiacid in medicine by reacting with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to produce salt,
        water, and carbon dioxide.<br></li>

  <h3>The Human Body</h3><button onclick="hideOrShowList(4)"><img id="4b" src="../assets/expand-list_button.png" width=32 height=32 alt="Expand" title="Expand/Contract"></button>
<ul style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden;" id="4">    
      <li>Sodium is used in neurological function in the human body and maintains a proper balance of water and minerals.</li>
      <li>Without sodium, the human body cannot regulate water, causing blood to be more diluted. <br>
      Too much sodium can cause a stroke or a heart attack; having too little sodium or too much sodium can be serious.
        See <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sodium+deficiency">sodium deficiency</a> and
      <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hypernatremia">hypernatremia</a>, respectively.</li>
      <li><strong>Extra!</strong> Water levels in cells are regulated by osmosis. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=osmosis">Osmosis</a>
        is a phenomenon where water moves through a substance that lets some liquid(water) through it to an area where there is less water than
        the other side.<br> In other words, water moves from where it is concentrated to an area of lower concentration, through a semi-permeable membrane.
        Salt can affect this process by changing the concentration of water in an area.<br> When salt has a higher concentration than water, water moves
        through membranes(such as human cell membranes) to that area in order to equalize the concentration of water. <br>
        When there is too much salt in the blood, water in cells move through the cell membrane through osmosis.<br> This causes the cell to dry out,
        and the reverse is possible when there is too little salt. In the reverse case, lots of water moves through the cell membrane into the cell,
        causing the cell to explode.

  <h3>Sodium Vapor Lamps</h3><button onclick="hideOrShowList(5)"><img id="5b" src="../assets/expand-list_button.png" width=32 height=32 alt="Expand" title="Expand/Contract"></button>
  <ul style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden;" id="5">
      <li>Sodium vapor can be added into lamps, where an electric current is run through to produce light from the emission spectrum of sodium.</li>
      <li>This type of lamp is incredibly energy-efficient, though this comes at a cost of producing nearly only intense yellow light.</li>
      <li>A high-pressure version exists that is less yellow, though it uses mercury and still has poor color rendering.</li>

  <ul style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden;" id="6">
      <li>Compared to lithium-ion batteries, sodium batteries are not as widely used. They are both rechargeable and function
      almost the same way.</li>
      <li>Sodium-ion batteries can act as a substitute for lithium-ion batteries; in some cases, they can be superior to lithium-ion batteries.<br>
        Sodium-ion batteries can charge very fast and also have a very long lifespan.<br>
        They also have a low fire risk at higher temperatures, meaning that they are safer.
      </li>
      <li>However, sodium-ion batteries have a lower energy density than lithium-ion batteries,<br> meaning that they cannot store as much electricity.
      This is because sodium atoms are larger in size and mass - less of them can fit in a battery,
        <br> and operate at a lower voltage compared to lithium-ion batteries. This makes sodium-ion batteries safer, though not as powerful.</li>
