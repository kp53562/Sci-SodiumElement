  <h1>Sodium - The 11th Element in the Periodic Table of Elements.</h1>
  <p class="font-sciency">
    There are numerous useful compounds that sodium can form, including sodium hydroxide, or lye, and sodium chloride, or table salt.<br>
    Because of its reactivity, especially with air and water, it is rarely used in its pure form, but some nuclear reactors use liquid sodium as a coolant
    (It has impressive thermal conductivity, explained in <a href="https://kp53562.github.io/Sci-SodiumElement/properties/properties.html">properties</a>);
    for the same reason, it is also used in science demonstrations.

  <h3>
    Lye

  <ul>
    <li>Sodium was first extracted and discovered through the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=electrolysis+definition">electrolysis</a> of this element.</li>
    <li>Lye was used even as long ago as 2800 B.C. in making soaps because of its ability to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=saponification">saponificate</a> fats and oils.</li>
